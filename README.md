# Online Shopping Application

Developed an online shopping application with a primary focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The backend was implemented using Core Java, leveraging multiple classes to ensure better maintainability and simplicity.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**
  - Follows OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Facilitates code reuse and modularity.

- **Class-Based Architecture**
  - Backend consists of multiple classes, each representing different entities and functionalities such as Product, User, Order, and Payment.
  - Enhances code organization and readability.

- **Maintainability**
  - Separate classes for different functionalities allow for easier updates and maintenance.
  - Changes or additions can be managed with minimal impact on existing code.

- **Simplicity**
  - Breaking down the application into smaller, manageable classes reduces overall complexity.
  - The codebase is easier to understand and work with.

- **Scalability**
  - The modular design supports scalability.
  - Allows the application to handle additional features and increased user load without significant refactoring.

- **Robust Backend**
  - Core Java provides a robust and reliable backend.
  - Ensures efficient performance and handling of application logic.

This project demonstrates the effective use of OOP concepts in building a scalable, maintainable, and efficient online shopping application.
