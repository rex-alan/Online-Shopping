# Online-Shopping

Developed an online shopping application with a primary focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The backend was implemented using Core Java, leveraging multiple classes to ensure better maintainability and simplicity. 

Key features of the project include:
    Object-Oriented Design: The application structure follows OOP principles, ensuring encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which facilitate code reuse and modularity.
    Class-Based Architecture: The backend consists of multiple classes, each representing different entities and functionalities such as Product, User, Order, and Payment. This modular approach enhances code     organization and readability.
    Maintainability: The use of separate classes for different functionalities allows for easier updates and maintenance. Any changes or additions to the application can be managed with minimal impact on existing code.
    Simplicity: By breaking down the application into smaller, manageable classes, the overall complexity is reduced, making the codebase easier to understand and work with.
    Scalability: The modular design supports scalability, allowing the application to handle additional features and increased user load without significant refactoring.
    Robust Backend: Core Java provides a robust and reliable backend, ensuring efficient performance and handling of application logic.
This project demonstrates the effective use of OOP concepts in building a scalable, maintainable, and efficient online shopping application.
